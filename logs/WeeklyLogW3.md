## Week 3 Log

This week has been mostly about looking into an aws (Amazon Web Services) server which is a Cloud Based Server. The purpose of this is to go about attempting to have a server with a database that can be online and accessible through a web application. I have almost all of my HTML coding done with the exception to a couple pages that I would like to talk with my grandfather about, and how he would like to easily enter data. The goal for the next week coming up is to look further into the idea of using an AWS server and database set up to keep track of all the information that Camp Floradan has to offer. Something else that I plan on looking into is looking into file exporting, such as creating a excel of PDF file from a database.
**I Will Attempt to re-install XAMPP and work at correcting it allowing me to test PHP and Mysql code on a localhost.**
I have now attempted to download and run XAMPP on my laptop. The error I was recieving was 	Error: MySQL shutdown unexpectedly.
