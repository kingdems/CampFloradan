# Week 5 Log

This week was mostly spent on working with php to allow for connections to be made between the website and the database that is being run through XAMPP. The database is working well, but I seem to be running into an issue with retrieving data and attempting to add it into the html page for more than one single row at a time, I am able to return a single row of information but having trouble doing more than that. Next thing that I have been working on is the add to mailing list which is the main source of how data is being entered into the database and it is working wonderfully.

In the next week I plan on continually working on the php code and get it done with soon which I can then start focusing totally on the exporting of the data from the database into a PDF document.
