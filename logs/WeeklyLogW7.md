##Weekly 7 Log

This week I have spent a majority of my time continually working on the PHP code to correctly send the inputed data from the accounts recievable page to the right sections in the data base. I have not been able to work on this as much as I would have liked this week due to the fact that I have sprained my ankle during lacrosse practice, this won't stop me from completing this project, it is just something that is prohibiting me from doing all that I want to be done as of now. 

From here I am continually working on the PHP code and getting that done. After I am done with this section of code I am moving to the attendance section of the application.
