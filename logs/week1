During this week, what I have been working on is going through, figuring out what I am going to need in my classes (Camper, Parent, Address, Pool) as well as looking into encryption codes to keep valuable information safe. I am also looking into myPHP Admin to create a database and set up a server. I am also looking into the ability to make this easier to input data into the database from different places, because not everything can be done from the office. Need an ability to change data from the canteen, as well as the pool with some information.
