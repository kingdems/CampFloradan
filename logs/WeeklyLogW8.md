##Weekly 7 Log

This week was spent focusing on the attendance section as well as starting on the pool list section. The attendance section is complete and now I am currently working on the poolList section.

Something that I am having some issue with is the section where I have a bunch of columns in my expense table and only one of 7 sections has a value while the rest are null so I am coming to the issue of finding the column that has a value and returning that to view the last query that was run on that table.

From here I am finishing up on the pool section and then from there I have to make my database exportable to a PDF file for easy printing and viewing of the information for someone who does not use computers well.
