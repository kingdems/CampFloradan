# Week 1 Log

During this week, I have been looking into and working with the directors of Camp Floradan to figure out what they are looking for in this project. How many tables and what needs to be within these tables. I have also been looking into encryption codes to keep valuable information safe. I am also looking into myPHP admin to create tables as well as setting up a server. I also looked into how easily it can be to input data from different devices because not all the information can be done from the office.
