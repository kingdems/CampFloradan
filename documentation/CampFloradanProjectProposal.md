# Camp Floradan Project Proposal
________________________________________
Creator: Jacob deMey

### Project Description

Camp Floradan is looking for a new way to keep records instead of their usual by hand method that allows for a lot of human error. The idea is to create a web application that can later be converted to a mobile app or allow for the web app to be used on mobile. The key features that the camp is looking for are that they would like multiple different sections (accounts recievable, mailing list, attendance, expenses and pool information). To achieve these, there should be a server and database system and using code such as HTML, PHP, and MYSQL (You may use others this is a base idea). With that in mind there should be a way for the users to access the data after entering it in a report format.
### Service Need

Camp Floradan of Putnam Valley in New York has a need for the ability to track data is a computerized fashion rather than the traditional by hand method they are still using today. A way to store valuable information on campers accounts, expsenses, and other camp needs. There is also a need for the app to be used by individuals who have very little to no technical literacy, and having the ability to view data in an easy to read format.

### Project Purpose & Scope

The scope of this project is only the design, build and implementation of this project. The up-keep and helping the users will not be touched upon in this project, those items will come after this project. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that can be scaled down and used on mobile, that can be used by Camp Floradan to allow for easy file tracking, attendance keeping among other things that should be addressed.
### Technical Challenges / Issues

There is no software or any process in place as of right now. Everything is being handled as new and being tested by the users that will eventually use this project in the years to come. These users have very low technical literacy and will be using the system extensively. Along with the web application I would like for the application to be mobile friendly as well to allow for easier use in the field of work.

## Requirements

###Design Requirements

Primary Pages:
    
    1. Accounts Reciavable (Billing Reports)
    2. Mailing List 
    3. Attendance
    4. Expenses (Camp expenses Reports)
    5. Pool Information(What end the campers are in shallow/middle/deep)
    
### Functional Requirements
 
Primary:
 
    1. Users will be able to input data.
    2. Users will be able to access and view data.
    4. Extremely easy to use.
 
 
### Technical Requirements
 
Primary:
 
    1. Cross-browser / platform support (IE, Firefox, Chrome, & Safari â€“ PC and Mac)
    
Secondary:
    1. Mobile supported
 
### Usability Requirements
        	
Primary:
 
    1. Will fully function in major browsers.
Secondary:

    1. Support mobile to some degree and provide enough functions.
 
### Project Constraints
 
**_Time constraints:_** We need a system working before the as soon as possible to allow for internal testing by individuals who will be using the product and which will allow for ample time for any changes that can be made. Mobile would be liked soon afterwards for off-site expenses entering leading up to getting the summer camp ready.

**_Scope constraints:_** This project is solely for creation, customization and implementation of the project. Once the project is complete then later will come maintenance and data checking.
